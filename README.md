Let's dry run the `combineByKey` example you provided to better understand how it works. I'll break down the steps involved, so you can see how the values are processed at each stage.

### Dataset:
We have an RDD of sales data for three products (`apple`, `banana`, and `orange`):

```python
sales_data = [("apple", 3), ("banana", 5), ("apple", 4), ("banana", 2), ("orange", 6)]
rdd = sc.parallelize(sales_data)
```

This creates an RDD where each entry is a key-value pair: `("product", sales)`. Here are the individual key-value pairs:
```
("apple", 3), ("banana", 5), ("apple", 4), ("banana", 2), ("orange", 6)
```

### Goal:
We want to combine sales for each product and compute the **average sales** for each product. We use `combineByKey` for this, which lets us define how to combine sales and count the number of occurrences (sales transactions) per product.

### Explanation of `combineByKey`:

- **Step 1**: `lambda value: (value, 1)`
    - **What it does**: This step initializes each value as a tuple `(value, 1)`, where `value` is the sale amount, and `1` represents the count of that sale.
    - For each product, this step converts:
      ```
      ("apple", 3) -> ("apple", (3, 1))
      ("banana", 5) -> ("banana", (5, 1))
      ("apple", 4) -> ("apple", (4, 1))
      ("banana", 2) -> ("banana", (2, 1))
      ("orange", 6) -> ("orange", (6, 1))
      ```

- **Step 2**: `lambda x, value: (x[0] + value, x[1] + 1)`
    - **What it does**: For each key (product), this step combines the values in the same partition (local aggregation). It updates the tuple `(sum_of_sales, count_of_sales)`.
    - **For example**: 
      - If we encounter `"apple"` twice in a partition:
        - First value: `(3, 1)` (initialized from the first occurrence)
        - Second value: `(4, 1)`
        - New combined value: `(3 + 4, 1 + 1) = (7, 2)` (sum of sales = 7, count = 2)
      - For `"banana"`, the process will be:
        - First value: `(5, 1)`
        - Second value: `(2, 1)`
        - Combined: `(5 + 2, 1 + 1) = (7, 2)`

    Now the partial results for each key within the partitions are:
    ```
    apple: (7, 2)
    banana: (7, 2)
    orange: (6, 1)
    ```

- **Step 3**: `lambda x, y: (x[0] + y[0], x[1] + y[1])`
    - **What it does**: This step merges the results from different partitions. If the RDD was distributed across multiple partitions, this would combine the intermediate results of the same key (global aggregation).
    - **For example**:
      - If `"apple"` appeared in different partitions with values `(7, 2)` and `(8, 3)` (hypothetical), it would combine them as:
        - `(7 + 8, 2 + 3) = (15, 5)`

    Since we don't have partitions in this small example, the final result remains:
    ```
    apple: (7, 2)
    banana: (7, 2)
    orange: (6, 1)
    ```

### Final Step:
Now we calculate the **average** sales by dividing the total sales by the count for each product:

```python
avg_rdd = combine_rdd.mapValues(lambda x: x[0] / x[1])
```

- For `"apple"`: Average = `7 / 2 = 3.5`
- For `"banana"`: Average = `7 / 2 = 3.5`
- For `"orange"`: Average = `6 / 1 = 6.0`

### Final Output:
```python
[('apple', 3.5), ('banana', 3.5), ('orange', 6.0)]
```

### Summary of the Dry Run:
1. The `combineByKey` function first initializes each value as `(sales, 1)`.
2. It then sums the sales and counts them within each partition.
3. After that, it merges results from different partitions (if needed).
4. Finally, we calculate the average by dividing the sum of sales by the count for each product.

This process is efficient in distributed environments, allowing us to calculate aggregations like averages across large datasets.
